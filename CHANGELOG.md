## [1.4.0] - 2026-05-21
### Added
- **Role-Based Experience Reorganization**: Fully separated the prototype into two isolated and targeted user flows without splitting the codebase:
  - **Patient Experience**: Screens 12 (Início/Checklist), 6 (Paciente Agenda), 13 (Meus Remédios), 14 (Meus Alertas), and 15 (Paciente Ajustes).
  - **Caregiver Experience**: Screens 7 (Painel do Cuidador), 11 (Perfil do Paciente), 8 (Agenda do Paciente), 9 (Central de Alertas), and 10 (Configurações).
- **Modo do Simulador Sidebar Switcher**: A segmented control (`Geral` / `Paciente` / `Cuidador`) in the sidebar control panel to filter screen access and redirect device viewports dynamically.
- **Bidirectional Ingestion Sync**: Checking/unchecking today's doses on Screen 12 (Início) immediately reflects on Screen 6 (Agenda) calendar checklist and recalculates weekly statistics.
- **High Contrast Mode**: Accessible glide-switch toggle inside Screen 15 (Ajustes) applying high-contrast body styling variables.
- **Dedicated Bottom Navigations**: Isolated bottom tabs per role (**Início/Agenda/Remédios/Alertas/Ajustes** for Patient vs **Pacientes/Agenda/Alertas/Config** for Caregiver).
- **Contextual Dialing Overlay**: Adapts system recipient labels depending on whether patient-to-caregiver or caregiver-to-patient call is initiated.
